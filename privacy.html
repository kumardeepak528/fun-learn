        <b>Fun Learn: Picture & Sound</b> does not integrate with third-party services, frameworks, or SDKs that collect or process any data from users.
    </p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy & Parental Rights</h2>
    <p>
        This app is created for children and complies with international children's privacy laws, including the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and similar regulations. Since we do not collect any information, there is no exposure of children’s data to us or to any third parties.
    </p>
    <p>
        If, in the future, personal information collection ever becomes necessary (for new features, accounts, etc.), we will update this policy and obtain verified parental consent before collecting such data.
    </p>
    <p>
        Parents and guardians have the right at any time to review, request deletion of, or prevent further collection of their child's personal information. However, at present, since no such information is collected or stored, no action is necessary.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
        We implement reasonable security measures to protect the app against unauthorized access or alterations. Since no personal data is collected, there is no user data at risk.
    </p>

    <h2>Legal Compliance</h2>
    <p>
        We comply with all applicable privacy laws and regulations. Should laws change or new data requirements arise, we will update this policy and, where required, notify users and obtain any necessary consents.
    </p>

    <h2>Policy Updates</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page, with a new effective date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically for any updates. If we make significant changes, we will provide an in-app notification or other appropriate means.
